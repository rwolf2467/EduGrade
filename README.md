```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull redwolf2467/edugrade

# Run container (accessible at http://localhost:8080)
docker run -d \
  --name edugrade \
  -p 8080:1601 \
  -v edugrade-data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  redwolf2467/edugrade:latest
```

**Done!** Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Configuration

Edit `app.py` to customize:

| Setting          | Default | Description            |
|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| Port             | 1601    | Server port            |
| Session Duration | 1 hour  | Login timeout          |
| Debug Mode       | True    | Enable for development |
| Rate Limits      | Various | Configurable per endpoint |

For production, change `app.secret_key` to a secure random string.

## Production Deployment

1. Set `debug=False` in `app.run()`
2. Use HTTPS via reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
3. Set `secure=True` for cookies
4. Configure proper environment variables
5. Set up logging and monitoring

## Student Access & Sharing

Teachers can create secure grade shares for students:
1. Select a class and subject to share
2. Set expiration time (1 hour to 30 days)
3. Configure visibility options (grades, averages, final grades, charts, etc.)
4. Generate unique PINs for each student (6-digit)
5. Students access their grades using the share link and their personal PIN

Students can view:
- Individual grades with color-coded badges
- Category breakdowns
- Class averages
- Performance charts
- Subject information
- Teacher name

## Attendance Management

EduGrade includes a comprehensive attendance tracking system to help teachers monitor student participation:

### Features

- **Track Attendance Status** - Mark students as present, late, or absent for each session
- **Attendance Statistics** - View detailed statistics including total sessions, present/late/absent counts, and attendance rate
- **Automatic Warnings** - Visual warnings in the student list when attendance drops near or below the minimum threshold
- **Color-Coded Alerts**:
  - 🟠 **Orange Warning**: Student is approaching the minimum attendance (within warning threshold)
  - 🔴 **Red Critical**: Student has reached or fallen below the minimum attendance requirement
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - **Minimum Attendance (%)**: Set the minimum required attendance percentage (e.g., 75%)
  - **Warning Threshold (%)**: Define how close to the limit a warning should appear (e.g., 5%)
  - **Auto-Grading**: Optionally assign failing grades to students with critically low attendance
- **Attendance History** - View complete attendance history for each student with dates and notes
- **Bulk Entry** - Quickly record attendance for all students at once

### How It Works

1. Go to **Settings → Attendance** to configure thresholds
2. Enable auto-grading if students should receive failing grades for low attendance
3. Click **Attendance** button to record attendance for a session
4. Select date and mark each student's status (present/late/absent)
5. Add optional notes for absences or late arrivals
6. Students at risk are automatically highlighted in the student list
7. View detailed attendance stats in the student detail view

### Example Configuration

- **Minimum Attendance**: 75% (students must attend at least 75% of sessions)
- **Warning Threshold**: 5% (warn when student is within 5% of the limit, i.e., at 80%)
- **Auto-Grading**: Enabled (students below 75% automatically receive a failing grade)

## Detailed Student View

Click on any student to view:
- Complete grade history with charts
- Category-wise performance breakdown
- Statistical analysis and trends
- Export to PDF for printing or archiving
- Visual performance indicators
